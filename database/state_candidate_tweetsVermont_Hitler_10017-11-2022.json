Will @GovernorVA teach WWII history about Hitler? Lincoln ? Kennedy? Reaganomics\u2049\ufe0f I\u2019d be an annoying as hell parent demanding to see lesson plans in REAL HISTORY",
    "1":"@RealLPerezLA I think it's a bit more complicated than that. Churchill also explicitly supported Mussolini in Italy but was against Hitler in Germany. I don't think it's accurate to call him a fascist but he was certainly fascist adjacent at various points",
    "2":"@covie_93 @RonFilipkowski Better that way, the visitor to Hitler\u2019s vacay spot in Germany.",
    "3":"@fakemadrid8 @real_fan14 Hitler vs Mussolini vs Stalin",
    "4":"Trump really makes a half-assed Hitler.",
    "5":"@eptthree Entire pax east floor looking like cyberpunk Hitler youth",
    "6":"@TomiLahren Looks like the Hitler  youth",
    "7":"@prestoneli2 @blackintheempir No, returnees to the homeland.  The law of return is real &amp; it\u2019s been followed for much longer than the general public knows.  In 1929 the Imam of Jerusalem led the riots against Jews who had been there for hundreds of years.  He eventually spent WWII w\/ Mussolini &amp; Hitler.",
    "8":"@andycorneys In Berlin in 1945 there were people crawling out of the rubble still supporting Hitler.",
    "9":"The right thinks the left are people with bad ideas. The left think the right are bad people with ideas! Ive written this again to point out the significance. Hitler was a self proclaimed leftist, and told his leftist followers the jews were the cause of all their problems.",
    "10":"@DrGJackBrown @elonmusk he's a chaos agent who thinks hitler is funny.  who are you talking to?",
    "11":"Ladies and gentlemen, I have obtained internal video from Elon Musk inside the Twitter bunker\u2014and it is phenomenal: https:\/\/t.co\/tRll5Tn17C",
    "12":"The left have arrested political opponents, have and still try to shutdown opposing voices, burned cities, Have escalated rhetoric towards maga to now terrorist.  This is exactly how Hitler started a holocaust.",
    "13":"@RichSementa Kinzinger and Cheney are modern day political equivalents of the gutless guy named Quisling who submitted to Hitler during the Nazi invasion of Western Europe- and whose name became the definition of a turncoat and buried the man himself in infamy.",
    "14":"It is for Trumpists\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/ASk215bOdl https:\/\/t.co\/B1vZc7vh3V",
    "15":"@benshapiro I was wondering as a jewish person, are you still a supporter of Candace Owens, who is advising people to read Hitler\u2019s biography ?",
    "16":"@donwinslow Trump and Hitler and other autocrats are children of chaos - both rising during chaos and deliberately creating more chaos, while positioning themselves as the strong man who can save people from the very chaos they're creating.",
    "17":"@mike_dillaha @DNelsonNC10 @ComicDaveSmith Well no, because again humans on their bodies and you can\u2019t take what you don\u2019t own. Hitler was taking things and saying he was doing it because he had more guns. I\u2019m defending what\u2019s already mine.",
    "18":"Replace extremist with Jews. This is exactly how Hitler got the Germans to turn on them. https:\/\/t.co\/CQFYgcgTr5",
    "19":"@DownHomeWoman @AOC @leezeldin Didn\u2019t expect to be giggling like a child at 3 am to \u201clittle Hitler.\u201d Idk if it\u2019s the sleep deprivation or the fact that you\u2019re actually correct with that statement",
    "20":"@JacobRAdkins @POTUS Yeah keeps ramping up the rhetoric just like Hitler did."
