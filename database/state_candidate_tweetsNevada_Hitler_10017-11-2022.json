    "0":"@RonFilipkowski He really plays the part of Hitler Youth well.",
    "1":"It's been a while since I read this issue but I am about 99% sure the reveal at the end is that this dude is LITERALLY Hitler https:\/\/t.co\/xkw4wMQnoq",
    "2":"@Marcelvisser10 @Gaia_Universe Dit is precies hetzelfde als wat er met Hitler gebeurde in de jaren 30. Een exacte copy",
    "3":"@0liviajulianna Look for the five o'clock shadow of his little Hitler moustache...",
    "4":"@adultswim That\u2019s what Hitler thought..",
    "5":"@dillangissel Hitler had both though",
    "6":"@RonFilipkowski Questioning a crooked election and made to look like the bad guys.  You people should of worked for Hilter, this is exactly what he did.  It worked for a bit and than you know what eventually happened to Hitler.",
    "7":"@TheFungi669 With the Hitler moustache?",
    "8":"@AlphaLackey @HistoryBoomer And Leopold died years before Hitler rose to power, so they were never on opposite sides of any conflict.",
    "9":"@AlphaLackey @HistoryBoomer Stalin wasn\u2019t on the other side originally, thanks to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and he rapidly took Hitler\u2019s place as an adversary for the West after WWII.",
    "10":"@AlphaLackey @HistoryBoomer Not needless \u2026 the original post was about an equivalent for Trump on the \u201cother side\u201d. Hitler was basically waging war on what would become known as the West, or Western democracies. In other words, the \u201cother side\u201d.",
    "11":"@AlphaLackey @HistoryBoomer So, which figure in the Western world would have been an equivalent genocidal dictator comparable to Hitler?",
    "12":"@AlphaLackey @HistoryBoomer There has never been a requirement for equivalences in direction, if not in magnitude. The existence of a Hitler did not require an equivalent on the other side, after all. Thinking that it just has led to some fairly lazy thinking in the past.",
    "13":"@MrMonacle0 Eh fuck hitler",
    "14":"@RepMTG I like your tweet, but we MUST keep aiding Ukraine. We've seen what Putin does. He nibbles away at territory he wants to pull into Russia. His goal to expand into an empire are being allowed as we keep saying it's not our fight... we said the same when Hitler invaded Poland.",
    "15":"@LilySimpson1312 Hitler was person of the year in 1938. The selection is not an endorsement (as no sane person would endorse or glorify either of these men). It\u2019s about who had the biggest effect on our culture.",
    "16":"@HawleyMO And candidates who aren't insurrectionists, traitor.\nI miss your cute little hitler moustache, baka...",
    "17":"@MarkAntiBabylon @PartyOnWayneH2 @LPNational https:\/\/t.co\/CUYhgJrt6h",
    "18":"@Zawistowski @ProctorRobert @YountCortesi @KGroskreutz @AdamKinzinger @GOPLeader This guy is UNHINGED. The Nazi lovers are the anti-free press Trumpers who have their misdeeds reported by honest (non Fox \"News\") journalists, unhinged election deniers, and those who support that Hitler wannabe, Putin.",
    "19":"@RadioFreeTom She would endorse Hitler if she could be the Magda Goebbels",
    "20":"@stephenasmith let me come on the show next week and get a real take on Nazi Germany\u2019s number 1 fan to educate you on how Anti-Semitism has been silenced since the Old Testament. You and your ESPN friends are all supporters of Hitler",
    "21":"@Cernovich @KurtSchlichter It's not that they want it it's that they think it's Republicans causing it, don't doubt me, it's insane but after 40 yrs of being called Hitler what do you expect",
    "22":"@Gaul__Soodman @CIA_in_China @egg88418727 @Gar74115921 @jdruva41 @Jaybefaunt the reason the conversation is \"focusing\" on the nationalities of Hitler's victims was because some dude claimed they were all German, which is historically inaccurate.",
    "23":"@willcain Get \u2018Em @willcain  These Leftists don\u2019t have a clue what division \u201cThey\u201d are causing. Democracy Will End! Hitler is Back! Republicans will kill for Power. They NEVER own ANYTHING!! Geraldo is Garbage."
