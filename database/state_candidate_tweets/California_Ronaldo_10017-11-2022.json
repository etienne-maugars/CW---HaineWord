    "83":"@ESPNFC Don't suspect there will be one coming.  A lot of talk about what a great talent and player #Ronaldo was, but nothing about what sort of a teammate he is.  Jordan was a jerk to play with, but he knew when to pass the ball, and he knew when to call time.",
    "84":"@SkySportsPL It's obvious #Ronaldo wants out and it appears he's going all-in on having a big WC.  Prove he's still valuable on the world stage and maybe someone comes calling in January.  Huge risk, and I don't think it pays off.  Either way, he's done at #MUFC.",

    "89":"@JackConant3 @disclosetv Doubtful.  Have you seen the proliferation of ads where they have Pulisic, Neymar, Messi and Ronaldo?  It's absurd, but shows the marketing emphasis.  FIFA can't have this go forward with no US.",

    "91":"Ive always been Messi over Ronaldo but i hate to see the downfall &amp; disrespect towards Ronaldo.",
    "92":"@ESPNFC And he's right.  But Zlatan, no stranger to ego, did not disrespect the club or the manager while he was there. He showed up, trained hard, and accepted the role he was given.  #MUFC made a huge mistake bringing #Ronaldo back.",
    "93":"@SkySportsPL I said that the day they signed #Ronaldo.  You don't move forward by looking to the past.  Other than sell a bunch of shirts, it did nothing to strengthen the club.  It's telling that none of his former clubs has the slightest interest in his return.",
    "94":"@Carra23 You're taking a lot of stick for this and many saying it's jealousy.  Only you know if that's true.  But as a #MUFC supporter I can honestly say that #Ronaldo has not only lost the club and the manager, he's lost the fans.",
    "95":"In time all we will remember is the goals and the trophies, but right now... #Ronaldo has forgotten what Sir Alex once said, \"no one is bigger than the club\".  He has to go.\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/PlLYs3FwgM",
