    "22":"@MattGaebler Yeah Gates even said after the game he's \"letting the players coach him\" a bit when it comes to these early rotations. Got to find your best 8 or 9 by January. We may not learn much until playing UCF, ku, Illinois, Wichita State coming up.",
    "23":"I didn\u2019t even play football til highschool (my grandma wouldn\u2019t  let me) the coach saw me in gym class going crazy and said he was gonna turn me into a basketball player .. to tight end like Tony Gonzalez and Gates .. i was like hell yeah .. bruh he had me playing LT and DE \ud83d\ude02",

    "27":"@KFlaherty247 But a team run (positive or negative) isn\u2019t on one player specifically. Obviously there are countless factors that play into the flow\/score if a game.\n\nUsing a stat to prop up (or dog) any one player when they don\u2019t 100% impact it is just not a stat I want anything to do with.",
    "28":"@KFlaherty247 What purpose would you say it serves? I don't see any way you look at a -3 on his stat line today and find it trustworthy of his play tonight.",

    "39":"That's a tough loss, considering you had the dagger and missed it. Gotta grow. Filipowski is a star and Whitehead getting healthy will be huge. Lots of ball left.",

    "65":"Can\u2019t throw a rock into the damn ocean. This might get ugly.",
    "66":"@bobbygottachill @MediaFoxx @ChiefsAholic If you go to Joes they talk about pulled pork but the Z Man is the most popular.  Q39 is great.  Jack stack ribs are awesome but pricey.  Gates has got great wings.  Can\u2019t go wrong at Arthur Bryant\u2019s either. ABs gotten huge praise from Presidents to Play Boy",
    "67":"@Riley_Gates We can agree to disagree. I also don\u2019t want to lose Norm.",

    "69":"@KeeganHeiland13 Tang had plenty of chances to move but never took them. Have not heard the same of Roberts. Just think a November game means not much of anything in terms of hiring a new head coach.",
    "70":"@Riley_Gates Sure. But he hasn\u2019t been in the focus. He\u2019s on full display tonight. He wins. He\u2019ll get some traction for coaching jobs. Jerome Tang was in the same boat. Norm just getting a chance to showcase on a huge stage tonight.",
    "71":"@KeeganHeiland13 He\u2019s been at KU for a decade. One game will not make his future, win or loss.",
    "72":"@Riley_Gates Absolutely. He\u2019s been tied to the best coach in college basketball right now for 9 years. If he wins this big game. He will be a hot commodity.",

    "74":"Fuck wrong wit Kevin Gates \ud83d\ude02",
    "75":"@MizzouHoops @coachdgates @Dmoi_VI Also, I recall another coach bringing their scrappy hard nosed players from a smaller school to #Mizzou about 15 years ago. \n\nThis team feels similar. You add in the recruiting? Dennis Gates is looking like an outstanding hire right off the bat.",
    "76":"#HereComesDuke #BeatKU\n\nThat is all. https:\/\/t.co\/UsqbztgBaa",
    "77":"Missouri basketball looked great tonight. They\u2019ve tangibly improved in these quick 4 games. There\u2019s a chance that Dennis Gates is super good at his job.",
    "78":"Mizzou has not played anyone yet but just remembering that Cuonzo Martin lost to UMKC 2 times makes what Dennis Gates is doing look heaven sent #Mizzou #4-0",

    "90":"Oh, Kentucky. How do you let that happen?",
    "91":"@ChrisTilelli @DrewHLive Or his right hand man Bill Gates and the Gates Foundation, which will get all of Warren Buffets money someday too. When that happens that foundation will be bigger than how many Countries?",

    "93":"Dick Vitale calling college basketball games again just feels right.",
    "94":"@SJacksonBET That is WELL known already",
    "95":"I think the Royals having a downtown stadium will be cool. I also am really bummed to be losing The K and the unique tailgating for games. I think it\u2019s cool to feel both ways.",
