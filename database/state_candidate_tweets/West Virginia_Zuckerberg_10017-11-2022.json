    "3":"@thebradfordfile Like when Zuckerberg gave $400M to combat voter fraud, which directed most of those funds to liberal pacs and initiatives? Oh wait, we didn\u2019t hear about that. Oh wait, like when Hunter B\u2019s laptop was given to fbi w evidence of crimes? Oh wait, nothing happened  with that.",
    "4":"@Kim_mee_Lan @NoLieWithBTC @donie WTF? Zuckerberg is going all Elon on us!",
    "5":"Thing is, if the Dems really do have the cheating infrastructure, we can't win no matter who. Haley and Scott would be the choice I would make, but with shit heads like Zuckerberg throwing hundreds of millions, they will buy the god damn election. It's probably lost.",

    "14":"@MandalorianGe0 @BoydDeuel @invest_wa @nytimes Facebook's ad revenue is dropping and it is dropping quite a lot. They are still profitable, but it is on a downward slope and that is why Zuckerberg wants to create the Metaverse, because that would be something Meta fully controlled.",
