    "0":"@CFCmerica Plays same position as Pulisic would have to be pretty high",
    "1":"https:\/\/t.co\/217T9cuaXO",
    "2":"Despite the loss, I really enjoyed watching the game, at Greystone in Chicago today. Pulisic got a nice ovation and even a chant. I\u2019m proud of Christian, proving yet again why he should be seeing more time at Chelsea. \n\nNow get after it in Qatar! https:\/\/t.co\/JdaYJhoFSI",
    "3":"Why is the ref pushing Pulisic like that?",
    "4":"@SeanCostello49 @PM_OfLoneliness @herculezg Then what\u2019s the point of bringing him. He\u2019s not going to replace pulisic if we\u2019re chasing and he\u2019s not going to play the 9. Waste of a spot.",
    "5":"@CFCNiko Good stuff. Pulisic is my fav player and passes the eye test for me so many times. Unfortunately, he will not get a fair shake from some of the fanbase and from a number of influencers. Sad, unfair, tiring but true.",
    "6":"@flippig123 @Lhufflepuffer @Chels_HQ You make me want to knock on Kai, but I happen to like him. Be better dude, Pulisic missed one but was good.",
    "7":"@Chels_HQ My 2 all-time favorite players. Both trashed by this trash fanbase. Pulisic played good yesterday, proud of him. Yes, he missed a sitter. So that allows you to fill your agenda. So obvious.",
    "8":"@stuholden @USMNT Everyone has to step up for the US to be successful, not just the main guys. When we come up against England or get to knockouts and face any other high caliber team, Pulisic, McKennie, Reyna and Dest may not be enough. This is where you make a name for yourself.",
    "9":"I'll share the cliff notes and all you need to know from this crew.\n\nPulisic: 6\nZiyech: 6.5\nHall: 8 https:\/\/t.co\/utwZDhMM8G",
    "10":"@usmntonly Lmao people trippin over Pepi. I\u2019m taking Pulisic, Weah, and Aaronson as a false 9 over him",
    "11":"So true, tired of the double standards. If you are English and miss a sitter, you get a pass. Pulisic played well today. That is all but forgotten though. https:\/\/t.co\/ENsvfETtKB",
    "12":"Lewis Hall and Pulisic, working well together.",
    "13":"Pulisic showing up, and no credit at all....lmao.",
    "14":"@AbsoluteChelsea If he kicks it straight, the keeper saves it. He\u2019s done that a lot. He was going to the left for the goal, but was unfortunately blocked. That\u2019s the right play by Pulisic. Bad luck.",
    "15":"What\u2019s the point of this? The only thing articles like this do is increase the hate certain players get.\n\nObviously Pulisic isn\u2019t at the levels of Beckham and Rooney when they played. That goes without saying, and I don\u2019t think anyone legitimately believes that. https:\/\/t.co\/B87v8EGRmN"
