    "2":"@CFCLefty Btw where pulisic i can't see it.",
    "3":"@AmericanHoolis Pulisic is hyped by Americans (and @MenInBlazers) because Americans have made such little impact in football. The reality is he would not have made the squad on any European side that qualified for the WC (or quite a few that didn't). (Not even getting into the Greggggg problem.)",
    "4":"@CFCLefty Ok pulisic avi",
    "5":"\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nThis guy doesn't even care about the attackers; Ziyech, Pulisic, Auba(benched), Sterling (Wingback, was fine under TT),.\n\nMan 0lays Gallagher as striker, then wingback \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 https:\/\/t.co\/fxnkGST9TF",
    "6":"@SerMM91 @ThatTallGuy91 I\u2019d rather play with 10 men than Pulisic &amp; Ziyech should be training with the kids until he can be sold after his attitude. I think that\u2019s half the issue with these players, no consequences for the shit they pull",
    "7":"Pulisic is honestly our biggest threat right now and that is devastating",
    "8":"@quinner12344 Dfkm last game both ziyech and pulisic been good should start both of them for this game.",
    "9":"Would like to see both Hutchinson and Pulisic on, if we have any interest in getting more than one point out of this match. Some pace flanking Broja would pose a threat and force Newcastle to be more honest defensively, opening up the match a bit.",
    "10":"@CFCLefty Pulisic will play in the K-league",
    "11":"I can\u2019t believe I am saying this\u2026we need Pulisic on @ScottyHayter",

    "17":"@nickski35 @Vintage_Cfc Simply not good enough, either of them. Pulisic has no awareness, no vision, headless chicken. Ziyech the laziest player I\u2019ve ever seen and looks pissed off at the mere thought of being asked to put his boots on. Both need to go.",
    "18":"Negatives. Pulisic is so poor, blind in the final 3rd, wastes attack after attack. Koulibaly is a concern doesn\u2019t look to have improved in form at all. Didn\u2019t jump for the 1st goal, lazy and lost his man for the 2nd. Mendy looks a shadow of himself. Havertz\u2026meh, Ziyech\u2026meh",

    "20":"@CFCParee I see no reason why he can\u2019t start. Drop KK (he\u2019s been poor). Get Thiago Trev and Cucu in at CB. Hall as LWB. I don\u2019t want to see Sterling there. I don\u2019t want to see Pulisic there. Has to be hall \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
    "21":"Pulisic is so shite",

    "26":"@A1Chels_ Hall having a fantastic performance, pulisic linking up well but as u said still wasteful needs to work on his finishing just like the rest of our attackers tbh and I have no words for Ziyech.",

    "36":"@Siya08_M @Lecrae__ @CFCMod_ For clarity sake , am not English. \nMount has 32 goals and 36 assists in his Chelsea career so far and pulisic ? Lol , I bet you don't want hear it , remember mount is a midfielder",
    "37":"@_kd2kd @ExpectedChelsea @ChelseaFC @SiandDanTalkCFC @ReeceJames @PremLeaguePanel Hutchinson is a RW and Pulisic is a LW so wyd ?",
    "38":"@Siya08_M @Lecrae__ @CFCMod_ Have you stop to think that maybe you are the stup!d one here , you talk about pulisic ? Wtf brr, he is that good and is being benched by mount a midfielder, if he was that good we wouldn't also have bought Sterling"
