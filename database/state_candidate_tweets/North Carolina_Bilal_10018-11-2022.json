    "0":"@megan_sword No fan of Bilal, but Eutrice is way over the top",
    "1":"@oucrimsongirl I am no fan of Bilal, but Eutrice comes across as rude and unhinged.",
    "2":"@Cmoneymontana ~ Bilal has been my favorite contemporary soul\/r&amp;b vocalist, besides myself (of course), for over a decade; I don't see that changing anytime soon. I'm always excited to hear what he's going to do. #336",
    "3":"@Emmaocon96 @90DayFiance She is desperate- Josh didn\u2019t propose and that\u2019s when she decided Mike is the safest bet. Even though her expectations of Josh were insane- he wasn\u2019t quick enough for her.  I get it- she wants a baby- reminds me of Shaeeda and Bilal- however, Bilal clearly doesn\u2019t want children",
    "4":"@UnpopularTimes @Bavasser11 @sweatsandpizza She wants a baby and Bilal clearly avoids every conversation- If they aren\u2019t on the same page there while her clock is ticking, she clearly needs to leave him\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f she is also going overboard with also owning a business at the same time! WHAT does Shaeeda really want?",
    "5":"Bilal is an ass but Shaeda\u2019s friend is something else as well #90DayFianceHappilyEverAfter",
    "6":"Bilal is such an A$#&amp;*Hole!!!!!",
    "7":"@CaptPiccard And the guest Bilal is in the \ud83d\udd25 seat \ud83d\ude02",
    "8":"Bilal is so repulsive he can\u2019t hide it Sheeda\u2019s friend is making a hit dog holler and I\u2019m here for it sense everyone else in the business Lol \ud83d\ude02 #90DayFianceHappilyEverAfter",
    "9":"Bilal is very sassy and defensive #90DayFiance #happilyeverafter",
    "10":"I don\u2019t understand. Shaeeda\u2019s friend isn\u2019t wrong in her intent but Bilal is questioning why you would be included in a convo abt his marriage and you\u2019re calling him rude. Y\u2019all just met. Lawwd. #90DayFiance",
    "11":"Bilal is a great value 50 cent #90DayFianceHappilyEverAfter",
    "12":"Bilal isn't my fav but he does make sense sometimes. Also sheeda needs to take her foot off the gas. She doesn't get her way and she immediately says he doesn't want me to work that's not what that man said. No kids on the other hand it's a no #90DayFianceHappilyEverAfter",
    "13":"Bilal is always going to have an excuse for not having children because he doesnt want (more) children, Shaeda! #90dayfiance #90dayfiancehea",
