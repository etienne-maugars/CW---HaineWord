    "4":"@mparham9 Pulisic and Weston have been awful too this year too. USA couldn\u2019t even beat teams like Saudi Arabia or Japan  a month ago. I think that coach will get fired after the tournament.",

    "7":"Woof, have a hit Willock. \n\nThat\u2019s deserved by all means. \n\nFive minutes of good play from Gallagher x Pulisic doesn\u2019t take away from the 60+ minutes of abysmal footy we\u2019ve played today. \n\nNow let\u2019s see how they respond.",

    "14":"I think that was an attempt at analysis from Craig Burley, but I\u2019m unsure\ud83d\ude05 \n\nDespite Burley\u2019s rant at halftime, that was a really, really good half from Christian Pulisic.\n\nHad a good early chance, but it took a harsh deflection. He set up Chelsea\u2019s best chance, too.",
