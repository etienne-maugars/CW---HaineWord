    "0":"@Richard99152776 @DOLPHINATOR77 @MadeInTheUSANJ @RepMTG You know to this day there are Russians that swear it's a lie Stalin starved tens of millions to death on purpose. Liberals are like that.",
    "1":"Almost everything you think of as \"Stalin-type things\" happened before that point https:\/\/t.co\/QET937zuwi",
    "2":"@carolanacharter it's like when communists or leftists say Stalin wasn't a true leftist cause he did bad things. It's a weak cop out ngl.",
    "3":"@RetroCoast They didn\u2019t. We happened to share enemies. It was not Joseph Stalin\u2019s side, nor in support of communism",
    "4":"@ZerekEX @GryphonPatches @Saturn_Marooned That\u2019s an incredibly low bar. Every old Bolshevik even the ones people dislike where believers in socialism hell Stalin wrote theory on that shit.",
    "5":"The idea that only Democrats can ensure fair elections is risible. No matter who is counting the votes every effort possible should be made to ensure fairness and transparency. Otherwise we live in Stalin's world where the only thing that matters is who counts the votes. https:\/\/t.co\/AeXRpeGLwe",
    "6":"@mtracey @JackPosobiec Every tyranny of the 20th century claimed to be a \u201cdemocracy\u201d-Stalin routinely bragged about his vote totals. He would be jealous that today\u2019s left can simply stay at home and produce mail-in ballots in whatever post election numbers needed.",
    "7":"@bfilo166 https:\/\/t.co\/M6uCnRMuPt",
    "8":"@kciws @bfilo166 @the_white_mouse LIAR!\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/M6uCnRMuPt",
    "9":"@grenier8_ruth @bfilo166 LIAR! \n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/M6uCnRMuPt",
    "10":"@GeorgeJedras @matthewdmarsden I\u2019ve seen this meme so many times and Josef Stalin was incorrect. It is those who MANIPULATE the votes that decide everything.",
    "11":"@AlaskanTzar Wouldn\u2019t expect anything less from the birth place of Beria and Stalin.",
    "12":"Assuming he\u2019s speaking for RU\/Putin, these \u201cgoals\u201d he thinks are straight out of the Stalin playbook. Problem for them is, they r actually playing out of the Nazi playbook. All this crap about \u201ciron will\u201d doesn\u2019t matter when you r fighting a capable army on multiple fronts. https:\/\/t.co\/sp1Bcocv6g",
    "13":"@richcoastrican Stalin?",
    "14":"If Putin had shown some patience &amp; taken the Gorbachev fork in the road instead of backtracking to the Stalin fork, Russia would be far better off today, maybe even be considered for NATO. No government can work effectively while drowning in a sea of corruption. Ukraine gets it. https:\/\/t.co\/Z2NWtHOig5",
    "15":"\"I consider it completely unimportant who in the party will vote, or how; but what is extraordinarily important is this\u2014who will count the votes, and how.\"\n- Joseph Stalin",
    "16":"@Sultan4Oz This is Stalin level loyalty test stuff. WTF",
    "17":"@FartherPhteven @VictoriaYastrub That's right. Because I support the actual goals of Lenin's revolution not Stalin's bastardization of them in the name of Marxism Leninism",
    "18":"@TFL1728 Similarities with Stalingrad? That time, the city had a strong symbolic importance as Stalin would accept any casualties to keep 'his' city. Not the same today.",
    "19":"@Admone7 Yeah and Hitler, Stalin, Mao.",
    "20":"@corncommunist Depends, I guess I stick to labor issues and honestly most people agree.  Just don't tell them who the people like marx or Lenin or Stalin that wrote about it and they seem to be fine.",
    "21":"@RobertoZagni @DaveB22664400 @hundehvalp723 @JamesPower91 @JordanTaylor57 @WarMonitor3 I think Stalin was suspicious of  all Soviet soldiers who became POW of other countries and locked them up, when they returned to Soviet-union. Soviet soldiers should fight until they were dead and not surrender.",
    "22":"Joseph Stalin famously said -It does not matter what the vote is- it is who counts the votes that matters. Arizona perfect example. Hobbs brazenly refuses debate, is complete dud, then fixes balloting and  results. She will likely manufacture enough votes to win."
