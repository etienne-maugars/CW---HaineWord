    "0":"@JackConant3 @disclosetv Doubtful.  Have you seen the proliferation of ads where they have Pulisic, Neymar, Messi and Ronaldo?  It's absurd, but shows the marketing emphasis.  FIFA can't have this go forward with no US.",
    "1":"@sethland @usmntonly @footballdaily Only Pulisic is in club hell at Chelsea, though. The others are all appreciated &amp; even loved. #USMNT",
    "2":"Who is the angriest #USMNT player?\n\nI think it's gotta be Tyler Adams. \n\nSmall argument for Pulisic as well--huge chip on his shoulder. Gio is more, like, sassy. \n\nMcKennie is funny cause he's all jokes and Harry Potter references, until you try to fuck with his teammates.",
    "3":"@USMNTRAWTAKES You think Pulisic's gonna have a chip on his shoulder vs ENG? Give me a \"Hell yeah!\" for $1000, Alex. #USMNT #FuckEngland",
    "4":"watching this chelsea game just hoping pulisic doesn\u2019t get hurt \ud83e\udee3",
    "5":"@CFCPys How does Gallagher (not even a winger) start over Pulisic and also get called up over Toney, he\u2019s honestly just mount with even less attacking threat",
    "6":"@OguchiOnyewu5 I want pulisic in bubble wrap right now",
    "7":"@peterclarke3 @CFCLefty Like the ones that Hall missed yet gets his debut? It's the Cobham\/ English tax. 1. Fuck the English 2. Pulisic needs to get a transfer early in the Jan window.\nOh, and fuck the English!",
    "8":"@bryanalowe @1776Footy @MenInBlazers Fair take. I like Bellingham a lot... probably my favorite English player... until he's not. (don't like the English for treatment of Pulisic, Marsch &amp; how they treat\/ perceive American fans... oh, and it's SOCCER!)",
    "9":"Pulisic starts as a false 9 or we riot.",
    "10":"@MiekWeek @tombogert Bro you guys seem to think that like because they were picked last they are the like 3rd stringers?? Dude this isn\u2019t nfl or fantays football literlaly the roster is already set most teams even usa just release the full roster in one go\ud83d\ude02 Pulisic coulda literally been last lmao",
    "11":"Pulisic does have pull https:\/\/t.co\/qmVOE2qr4J",
    "12":"#Deportes| Posterior al partido de la Selecta ante Estados Unidos por la Liga de Naciones de Concacaf, el atacante del Chelsea ingl\u00e9s, Christian Pulisic, calific\u00f3 como un \u2018desastre\u2019 jugar en el estadio Cuscatl\u00e1n por  las condiciones del terreno.&gt;&gt;\ud83d\udc47\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/Deml83BMMs",
    "13":"@Eder_Tonel Captain America, Mr, Pulisic nos har\u00e1 campeones bro! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc",
    "14":"@ono_cod @NUFC__Joe @Martin_The_Cat @StoolFootball Just listening to those guys, you can see they don't know anything about the game &amp; only know about what they've been told about Pulisic... by someone who also doesn't understand the game.",
    "15":"@MicheleG3 Right now, I am more worried that Pulisic keeps missing sitters. We'll continue backing him, but he's earned some of the scorn from CHE fans by not converting. You can miss some, but he misses that vast majority (yeah, I know Sterling does, too... doesn't mean it's acceptable).",
    "16":"Pulisic smh",
    "17":"@GabeoZaos Pulisic, Ziyech, Kovaci\u0107, Loftus-Cheek, Aubameyang e Havertz n\u00e3o fariam falta alguma (como 9 prefiro Werner do que Havertz)"
