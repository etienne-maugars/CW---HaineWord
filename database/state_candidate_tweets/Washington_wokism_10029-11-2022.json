    "1":"@irwin_josiah @beinlibertarian @elonmusk Kinda my point.  If this is the Mecca of \"wokism\", then it's truly a horrid, snarling, wannabe ethical elitist trend that spends at least half of its energy hacking on the \"unwoke\".  No one declared them the keepers of understanding, I sure as hell ain't impressed.",
    "2":"@TansuYegen Cleaning your own school was once a routine in India as well but then wokism walked in!!",
    "3":"@GOPLeader @KellyannePolls I'm thankful for a House GOP majority that's going to save a country that the Dems have seriously screwed up (open border, inflation, nuclear war, gas prices, wokism, etc.).  Exactly how are they going to do it &amp; are they all committed to cut out the crap &amp; get the job done?",
    "4":"@MaggieSheehan55 @djrothkopf That has nothing to do with wokism.",
    "5":"@Kultcher @Halalcoholism The fact that you're acknowledging that there is legitimate discussion to be had means you're not so woke that you're insane. That's what the runaway wokism often claims, that's it's a full stop, end of discussion about a variety of topics and issues.",
    "6":"@CATTLECAPERS The wokism that makes up much of syndication today would not be something Schulz would've supported. They rightly support his work, but while ignoring his conservatism.",
    "7":"@CarlNyberg312 @elonmusk Drag queen story time and castration for slightly effeminate boys, mastectomy for Tom girls, men in women\u2019s sport, women\u2019s locker rooms, compelled speech to conform with radical cultist ideology \u2018wokism does no harm\u2019",

    "9":"@RebelNews_AU How can that be. And I thought coal was very bad for climate change. I guess when you have to choose between wokism and reality, reality always wins out."
