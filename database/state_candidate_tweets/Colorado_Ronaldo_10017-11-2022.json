    "91":"@liannesanderson It is not weird. You select the team that performs. Thus far, Garnacho is performing even above the likes of Sancho whom I would have on the pitch over Ronaldo. So, Garnacho is more than earning his place.",
    "92":"@MrWickUTD @AdamMcKola @Pablo___93 Ownership problems is a well known issue at this club. Ronaldo waffling about it amidst his poor display on the pitch is solely to cover his lackluster performances.",
