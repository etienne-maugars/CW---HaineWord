    "0":"@Lauren3veMemes @AKA_RealDirty @DEVILDOGMEMES It's not the Vote that counts --- it's who counts the vote.      Joseph Stalin",
    "1":"@RonFilipkowski Straight-up Stalin",
    "2":"@iniminimagimo81 @JackPosobiec Western Ukraine is mostly Russian?  I think you mean Eastern.  And, much of that is because of Soviet\/Stalin importation of Russians to repopulate Eastern Ukraine after soviet pogroms did away with a whole bunch of people either by starvation or removal.",
    "3":"@StevenHorrobin @Tendar Well, Stalin did it in 1941 (albeit further upstream) and killed tens of thousands of his own civilians - is Putin any better?",
    "4":"Russia strikes into Poland. Traditionally Russians have hated Poles. Stalin killed as many as he could. He was convinced that they spied on him. Poland has always known that they were next on the list. https:\/\/t.co\/B83RYcOf3S",
    "5":"@Jaybefaunt @Convict_No9653 Just read Lenin and Stalin. Much easier to digest.",
    "6":"@AlphaLackey @HistoryBoomer Stalin wasn\u2019t on the other side originally, thanks to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and he rapidly took Hitler\u2019s place as an adversary for the West after WWII.",
    "7":"@leslibless Joseph Stalin said some version of \"It's not the people who vote that count, it's the people who count the votes.\"",
    "8":"@nvdems Joseph Stalin said some version of \"It's not the people who vote that count, it's the people who count the votes.\"",
    "9":"@Timcast One way to solve homelessness.  This is how Stalin cleaned up Moscow of it\u2019s homeless czarists.",
    "10":"@Dieter75 @cornpop123456 @Daves_n0t_here @simongerman600 \"100 gajillion killed by Stalin's hands vuvuzela nord korea\" lol it's clear you've never done any actual research, you just look at 'figures' that agree with your feelings and never dig any further.",
    "11":"@PastorPeter77 @uribrito @mpaganr34 @FrogMortonAgain Tell that to the history of the church. Tell that to all the martyrs...tell that to Jesus Christ who could have call 12 legions of angles...tell that to the Chinese Christian...I could go on and on. Where is Stalin and the Soviet Union now?",
    "12":"@ScepticalAussie @LaloDagach One wonders if the Russians had joyfully pushed Lenin aside for Stalin on the grounds that he was \u201csmarter\u201d, would it still have been a good move?"
