    "0":"@djrothkopf There's nothing tolerant, decent, kind or respectful about wokism. \nIt's just bullying in disguise, therefore it deserves all the mockery in the world.",
    "1":"@zionist_nat Children learning about LBGTQ+ people, and that it's OK to be gay, is not \"wokism\". It's not \"sex education.\" You obviously agree with that because you allow your child to meet and love and know about her grandparents. It has nothing to do with sex, it's about being who you are.",
    "2":"@StephenKing I hope this book is not just more wokism masquerading as a sci-fi\/horror novel.",
    "3":"@EgotasticSports Wokism is a cancer. The hypocrites who cancelled this kid are scum. Context matters. If you don\u2019t like the word, stop putting it in song lyrics. It\u2019s in songs because the Wokes want this to happen."
