    "1":"@alittlechop @povbeerleague @TimLajoie3 @CalvinMcgettig1 @JackPosobiec So how do you feel about bishops banning her but not lawmakers who support death penalty?  Seems like that kind of hypocrisy would immediately make any morality decision by Church irrelevant.",
    "2":"@alittlechop @povbeerleague @TimLajoie3 @CalvinMcgettig1 @JackPosobiec How do you feel about death penalty?",
    "3":"@TimLajoie3 @CalvinMcgettig1 @JackPosobiec Yeah, but if they're going to do a ban for going against Church, the same logic should apply to Republicans who support death penalty.",
    "4":"Death penalty for selling drugs\u2026..trippin",
    "5":"There are other aspects of being pro life besides abortion. Why not continue to hold this rally and focus on things like ending the death penalty and proper paid parental leave?\n\nAll this says to me is that abortion is the only thing pro life people care about. https:\/\/t.co\/3Oi4vaBY6P",
    "6":"@Katerintree Wild and crazy idea, but hear me out. Why not still hold the federal March for life, but actually focus on the other aspects of being truly pro life, like an end to the death penalty and proper paid parental leave.",
    "7":"@miles_commodore Then how can a Christian join the military or be for the death penalty? Hypocrisy on both sides.",
    "8":"I think the death penalty should only be for rapist https:\/\/t.co\/QUnOpZzgPJ",
    "9":"@davramdavram That's so sick. Tell me, what crime did the dead baby commit? The rapist hasn't been prosecuted, but the baby got the death penalty. Liberal justice.",
    "10":"Benton County Prosecutor Nathan Smith announced he is charging Amber Waterman with two counts of capital murder and will be seeking the death penalty. https:\/\/t.co\/Me3773eWPG"
