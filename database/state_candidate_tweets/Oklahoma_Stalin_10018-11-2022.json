    "1":"@WhoKnowsAnymre @MatthewDownhour I don't think I implied that, exactly. But you do cover for them constantly, like you're doing now. The left is far too comfortable embracing Stalin-style authoritarianism. And for some reason, it makes them want to defend Putin as well. And he's not even communist.",

I don\u2019t worship men or politics, I\u2019ll leave that up to you. \n\nNone of you will be happy until this place turns into Rwanda. Difference between the 2?

    "7":"@VampyAnji Don't you love it when you say \"Yeah communism is a great idea with the exception of every single time it's been tried.\" haha\n\nAnd the typical response is \"Well if the USA didn't blah blah blah\"\n\nIt's like \"Yeah the USA caused Stalin to murder 20 mil of his own country men\/women\"",

He hoped the city would fall before Winter but Stalin pushed through winter and into February (during the summer they moved the factories east and trained the army in Siberia).",

I'm saying that if we did regulate, the rest of the world would have to increase their cost. And the other countries would have a problem. Remember when Stalin tried to regulate food prices? Famine in Ukraine. There is a balance.",

    "17":"@_CLancellotti @AnthonyMariaOP @tonyannett Perhaps, but only perhaps--certainly along the line from Marx through Lenin and Stalin, the industrial proletariat was insisted upon.  Hence the Bolshevik hostility to the S.R. and the Party's end-run around the actual soviets--the rejection of \"agrarian reformers\" was dogma.",
