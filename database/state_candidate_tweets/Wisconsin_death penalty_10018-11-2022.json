    "0":"@Mahollowman Thanks for reaching out @Mahollowman. Im not sure how i feel about that.  Even if we did have the death penalty, it would take 10-20 years for the system to see that through. \n\nGod has his own Vengeance in store for this guy. I believe it will be worse anything we have in mind.",
    "1":"@Timcast maybe when DT says he wants the death penalty for drug dealers he is actually saying he plans to defund the CIA.",
    "2":"@AlexanderDiazAZ When he says \"the death penalty for drug dealers\" is that an undercover way of saying he's going to defund the CIA and FBI?",
    "3":"@CNNSotu He sounds like Dukakis when Dukakis was asked about the death penalty if his wife got raped and murdered.",
    "4":"@Crazyeffindave1 @SteveMackay @WaukeshaAlerts Death penalty is the easy way out imo. Let them rot for 60 years in prison before they die instead of giving them a painless injection",

    "8":"Trump wants the death penalty for \u201cdrug dealers\u201d. \n\nAin\u2019t he\u2019s suppose to be in Jail ?",
    "9":"Most of Trump's speech was low energy fluff but 2 promises that he has made that I like are:\n\n1. Death penalty to drug dealers \n2. Term limits\n\nEverything else that he said just sounded bland and repetitive.",
    "10":"@riseupandresist the fact that they just basically said \"lets put anybody above the age of 30 at risk of myocarditis\" should earn them the death penalty. pushing or allowing this poison on to my sister, best friend, mother, uncle and grandmother \n\nthey should burn in hell.",

    "13":"On Tuesday, Iran voted to impose the death penalty on all protesters in custody as a \"hard lesson\" for all rebels. The majority in favor of the penalty was considerable, 227 out of the 290 total members.\n\nThis is why we must fight back against theocracy!\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/EhKP9ITtth"
