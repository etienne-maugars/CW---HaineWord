    "0":"@CFCmerica I think it\u2019s people are used to using MMA along with Pulisic, Jesus, and Weah, so who comes off?",
    "1":"@ballin_bernardo I think Reyna, Weah, and Pulisic are all more creative, and I think work rate is one of the few things our team isn't lacking \ud83d\ude42",
    "2":"@SoccerTalk_10 McKennie is the easiest answer. He hasn\u2019t played a competitive match in almost a month. The unpopular opinion is Pulisic. Keep the MMA mid &amp; put Aaronson out wide",

    "6":"\u26bd\ufe0f It\u2019s been a rough few weeks as a Chelsea supporter. At least Pulisic was looking to have a little better form heading into the World Cup.",
    "7":"Official and Longstaff trying to hurt Pulisic? Lol",

    "13":"@HarryW34 @CFCLefty Well, that's interesting because that seems like exactly what you're doing. Probably wank to a Mount poster and that would explain why you're blind. Nice try, mate! Nationality aside, Pulisic has been the most dangerous attacker Chelsea has.",
    "14":"@HarryW34 @CFCLefty Do you watch the matches or just read Twitter? Actually, might be neither since even Chelsea Twitter is on Pulisic's side these days.",
    "15":"@HarryW34 @CFCLefty Well...that'd make sense if Pulisic didn't look miles better than Havertz, Mount, Broja, Gallagher, and Sterling lately but nice try!",
