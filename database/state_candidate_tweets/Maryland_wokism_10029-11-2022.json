    "5":"You might imagine there is a free speech absolutist philosophy that would justify what Musk is doing with twitter, even if you think it\u2019s misguided, but there is no way that aligns with supporting a serial censor like DeSantis. \n\nIt\u2019s just straight anti-wokism.",
    "6":"@wil_da_beast630 The guy in the video is CORRECT, that the vast majority is pro-human\/ anti-divisive-wokism.\nI continue (for 29 yrs) to travel every corner of this nation and the world, interacting 1-on-1 with hundreds of people from all walks of life &amp; we are pro-common-ground\/ pro-humanity",
    "7":"@wil_da_beast630 As a busy mom and flight attendant over the last 20 years, I ASSUMED that the cultural values (stated in the video above) I grew up with as a Gen-Xer would always be the American way.\nIt's terrifying what is happening- the complete institutional capture of Kendi's wokism",
    "8":"@JoshuaPHilll Fascist to be against wokism? That's a leap.",
    "9":"@DavidKrae @DustinMont @GoodPoliticGuy Okay, but I don't think a lot of folks on the right make this distinction either and think that \"wokism\" is when the gays are on tv for five minutes.",
    "10":"@elonmusk @CSS976 @getpaidwrite The right\/left paradigm is archaic. The new battle is between wokism and liberty.",
    "11":"@elonmusk We're the same age...the majority of people I see that are not captured by wokism is our generation. \nGen X is the last generation that's not retired, that has experienced what we need to get back to.\nWe have to win the culture war by speaking up and BUILDING",
    "12":"@elonmusk Seems to me that the right has made up a false culture war between them and the left here in the US.  Their fear of the dreaded \"wokism\" is comical. The real culture wars are the international and global ones such as those related to income disparity and climate.",
    "13":"@drmistercody If woke had stayed within the original definition, no one would have issues. But they have become radicalized - just like a benign tumor turning cancerous. So, too bad, we are coming with \u201ccure the cancer of Wokism\u201d",

    "20":"@sanjeevsanyal Wokism has no limit . They know that by 18 at least some can understand the liberalism is not so great. So allow the voting limit to 1 and then state can vote on their behalf.",
    "21":"@zhang_heqing Let's have fun\n\nPopularize the image of Candice Owens, and Kanye west. Why? The west hates it and demonizes it. The same way where people who represent \"wokism\" are popularized should be the same way intelligent Africans are popularized but even greater. \n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/kczifI0ep2",
