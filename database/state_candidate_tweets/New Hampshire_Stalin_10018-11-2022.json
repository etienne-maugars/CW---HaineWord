    "2":"@CougarSpider @agraybee 1984 was written during the Stalin era iirc, and Orwell while it was ahead of his time among some socialists in calling Stalinism out, it would not have the hindsight of Destalinization revealing how much of a mess it was.",
    "3":"@JamesMLindsay From Jane Meyer: In 1933 Fred Koch built refineries in Germany essential for Hitler's war effort. This after Koch helped build Stalin's oil refinery industry.

    "11":"@xceejaysk @Tarushdei @Stephakaii @pavedwalden @DoremiRodenburg @commonismnow The lesson of Stalin, of Mao, of Putin and Xi is that there will *always* be leaders like this, and if handed the full reign over the economy, they will invariably use it to enrich themselves.

    "12":"2 yrs after it was printed, 16 Uzbek officials featured in the book fell victim to Stalin's infamous purges; libraries were asked to destroy their copies and owners were encouraged to blot out the faces of those purged. for this reason, it's very difficult to find a copy 4\/ https:\/\/t.co\/C3NU87a4RZ",

    "16":"@octavioaleonpa1 @roballemachtig @PhillipsPOBrien Personally, I wouldn\u2019t argue with Stalin and Khrushchev\u2019s assessments.  No question \u2014 Russia paid a very high price, once Hitler betrayed and invaded them, and there was no other choice.

    "32":"@RadioFreeTom It's sad to see all the progressives using logic to attempt to refute your near factual observation about class warfare.   The trope of anti-intellectualism has run deep in the GOP since the Regan days, they would never believe it's from Stalin's playbook!!"
