In essence the broad repeal of laws based on rarely constitutional grounds, like overturning abortion on any religious ground is effectively contradictory of the original goal of the constitution.",
    "8":"Dobbs sure is looking like a Pyrrhic victory for the right.\n\nThe court win not only costs them in a midterm in which they should have dominated, but courts continue to limit\/slow state abortion banning measures.\n\nWhat was it all for, other than an intent to gut Griswold v. Conn.?",

    "24":"@mschlapp Do you want your daughters too? Because that might not be your reality if they are denied safe abortion to deal with life-threatening complications, like ectopic pregnancies.

But they don\u2019t want what would lower abortion numbers either, that is ample education and free\/easily obtained birth control. So they call us baby murderers while simultaneously not changing anything, or even making it worse.",
    "35":"@JessicaTarlov I personally know a couple who have a four-year-old son that was born at 24 weeks. As a mother, you should be ashamed of yourself for supporting late-term abortion. Thank you @greggutfeld for standing up for the most innocent.",
    "36":"@saintsundere This whole \u2018add abortion to the constitution\u2019 thing is absolutely bizarre.\nNeither California nor Vermont were likely to write a statute restricting it in the first place, and only their own statutes would be limited by their own constitutions... which they can amend freely.",

    "41":"@jasonfurman @muffin3118 Most pundits, particularly male ones, seem to have super underestimated abortion rights as a driving factor. Seems like that's the biggest shift from priors to me.",
    "42":"@DavidDzimianski He didn't. The Nazis supported abortion enthusiastically. Just like Leftists do",
    "43":"@Acyn I decided to vote on abortion rights vs a fake narrative involving litter boxes in school bathrooms. Say what?? \n\nAnd the rate of illegal immigration as reported by R\u2019s would have already tripled our population since trump left office. \n\nSorry I choose to live in reality.",

    "53":"@NickAdamsinUSA Lol, it takes acknowledging gender equality. There are a lot of women in this country, and taking away their right to choose abortion was a grave mistake. Regardless of how you feel about it, no one should be able to control others with their body. Sorry Hooter's boy",
    "54":"@SueBhunny1964 @DWUhlfelderLaw If he was real, he\u2019d look at you and say \u201cGFK\u201d. If he was real he would say he doesn\u2019t want a ban on abortion, he wants a ban on guns.",

    "56":"@TomBuck I didn\u2019t expect this election to reveal so much wickedness and determination to murder. Every campaign ad I saw here in CO was about abortion and how the conservative candidate wants to take away freedom to choose and remove \u201cmedical\u201d decisions.",
    "57":"@alexisniiic This is how common sense has gotten lost! The Republicans are just saying hey we don't wanna pay for your abortion you can get an abortion just fund it yourself! So get it right",
    "58":"@jc_bradbury I agree, I don\u2019t think she ran a good campaign. Especially since Brian Kemp\u2019s first term wasn\u2019t seen as a disaster. I think it was a miss to not paint Kemp as more extreme (anti abortion) than he appears.",

    "61":"@billiamjacobson @Rossputin Body autonomy. Please. Polis signed legislation saying abortion will remain legal here. It\u2019s a states\u2019 rights issue. And sadly you can abort up to 40 weeks here. That\u2019s extreme and evil. I didn\u2019t vote for your \u201cbody autonomy\u201d BS.",
    "62":"An interesting thought on CNN. With Republicans putting Abortion on ballots as an issue being taken up by certain states, many more young people &amp; pro-choice individuals may have been driven to polls that wouldn't have, likely leading to less Republican wins. Screwed themselves?",
