    "0":"@DanThomasESPN Why do you hate Pulisic so much?",
    "1":"Pulisic feeling 'very good and prepared' for WC https:\/\/t.co\/HtA4Fn1fr6 https:\/\/t.co\/ENlmQwCStm",
    "2":"@DirtAndSprague @BobbyMarks42 @1080TheFAN Also when is soccer Dirt breaking down the Group stage games? USA v Wales is Monday. LAFCs Gareth Bale vs Pulisic. Ted Lasso is writing notes on billboards. Qatar is hiding beer tents! Is it Messi\u2019s last chance with Argentina?",
    "3":"@usmntonly pulisic got that first day of school pic taken by your mom smile",
    "4":"@Michael_Grigs26 Oh right, idk why I thought it was Thanksgiving. But need Pulisic to be useful for once",
    "5":"@EMcX87 @joey_H_st @MenInBlazers And we Qualified thanks to goal difference. At halftime of the Honduras game we were 8th in the Octagon.Pulisic + Reyna were hurt. McKennie was suspended. The MLS \"veterans\" were invisible. Then Pepi delivered. By the end of the game we were 4th with a +3 GD. Then he did it again",
    "6":"christian pulisic ass cheeks \ud83d\ude02",
    "7":"@N_Jow19 @WestCoastKing @AnarchoMayo Out wide we play two at a time and we got Pulisic, Reyna, Aaronson, and Weah. At CM we will also play two and we got McKennie, Musah, LDLT, and Reyna says that's his preferred position. At CDM we'll play just one and we got Adams and Acosta. There's no place for Roldan here.",
    "8":"@ttaldridge @StanUsmnt Hummels succeeded at Bayern and Gundogan at ManCity (as well as Auba and Lewy). But I\u2019d say Dembele, Gotze, Sancho, and Pulisic have all underperformed their transfer values.",
    "9":"@goobysnack1 @thereal1_ai @MaxBretosSports And we had 2 starters and 2 backups. On the wings we should have 2 starters and 2 backups. At LW it's Pulisic and Aaronson, at RW it's Weah and Reyna. Morris doesn't deserve any playing time if you have those 4 who play his same position. And no, he's not gonna be CF either.",
    "10":"@goobysnack1 @thereal1_ai @MaxBretosSports Normally we bring 4 center forwards on a 23 man roster. We brought 3 center forwards on a 26 man roster... Morris getting any minutes when he's competing for playing time on the wing with Pulisic, Weah, Aaronson, and Reyna is a lost cause. Morris should withdraw. Pepi or Pefok in",
    "11":"@FOXSoccer @USMNT @AlexiLalas @stuholden @StatManMosse @AlexiLalas Could it be that Haji is Pulisic's best bud on the squad and Gregg is hoping he will help get the best version out of one of the team's most important players..?",
    "12":"Pulisic\u2019s decision making in the final third is comical. Looking forward to the World Cup.",
    "13":"Pulisic scuffed that shot \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f #MCICHE",
    "14":"@usmntonly Now go get Pulisic in January",
    "15":"@NBCSportsSoccer Of course Pulisic but I'll also say Musah. Think he has a breakout tournament."
