    "3":"@xmax65 @xbtPBH Stalin was a very important figure in the movement.",
    "4":"@wil_da_beast630 As a number, it seems scarily possible. After all, Mao and Stalin killed more people than that. \n\nBut examining where they are and what they're doing, I can confidently say this would be nearly impossible.",

    "15":"@photosbykieran @jmzz_55 @VP @POTUS EXACTLY.  This whole phenomenon of treating our leaders like demigods is something straight out of Stalin's USSR cult of personality.  Frightening.
