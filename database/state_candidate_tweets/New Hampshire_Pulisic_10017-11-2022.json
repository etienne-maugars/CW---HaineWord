    "19":"Also, when are we going to stop our opponents taking quick free kicks against us, like every other team does to us? That second goal was down to Ziyech and Pulisic. Again.",
    "20":"The laziness from Pulisic there is shocking.",
    "21":"Pulisic needs to go a counter attacking team he\u2019s thrive there. As for Chelsea no. Zyiech has to go so does Havertz. Mount should stay.",

    "23":"I just saw the reply Pulisic actually completely scuffed it and the ball deflected off the defender. My word this man needs to go yesterday.",
    "24":"@11Yanks This would be such a mistake. Especially if Pulisic and Reyna are on the field at the same time, you need the work rate of Sargent and Aaronson to balance. Because as good as Reyna and Pulisic are on the ball, they don\u2019t press high and they don\u2019t make recovery runs well.",
    "25":"Pulisic putting his head down after missing Ziyech\u2019s pass. That ain\u2019t the attitude that\u2019ll win you games tbh.",
