    "0":"It all starts Monday for The World Cup! Excited to start I\u2019d off with this @cmpulisic Prizm Landmark. \n\n#ElMundial #Landmark #PaniniAmerica #Prizm #Pulisic #USA #LetsGo #FIFA @ Chandler, Arizona https:\/\/t.co\/mYB4UaWYzi",
    "1":"ESPN FC called Craig Burley the \"Scottish Christian Pulisic\" and I almost died... https:\/\/t.co\/v6AkMUCUy0",
    "2":"Pulisic  Donovan  Mix https:\/\/t.co\/gxQZA7iL9E https:\/\/t.co\/qvnez1lDq9",
    "3":"@ChelseaFCSkye @Crossroads_CFC The real question is... how do we blame Pulisic or Sarri?",
    "4":"@JordanBrenner We just never play well when Aaronson starts on the wing. If we're playing Berhalter's system, I think Weah has to start. If I get to pick my system, I think Reyna\/Pulisic\/Aaronson are close to interchangeable. Reyna\/Pulisic better at 10 than Aaronson, but he CAN play there.",
    "5":"@JordanBrenner Right now I think McKennie. Injury + form dip. In a 4-4-2, I'd go:\n\nSargent-Pepi\nReyna\nPulisic - Musah\nAdams\nJedi - Ream - Zimmerman (or CCV) - Dest",
    "6":"@JordanBrenner I think it's going to be standard, though.\n\nFerriera\nPulisic\/Weah\nMcKennie\nMusah\nAdams\nJedi\/Long\/Zimmerman\/Dest",
    "7":"@JordanBrenner We know they SHOULD get out. I think Aaronson and Reyna start on the bench simply because Berhalter\u2019s system only works if Weah and Pulisic are the wingers. He relies on their speed so much. The offense without Weah has been nonexistent.",
    "8":"Ending of that new castle game is great haha Ref freaking shoved Pulisic",
    "9":"lol I swear if Pulisic actually got hurt in the 98th minute",
    "10":"NBC commentators wanking over Pulisic coming off the bench",
    "11":"Throw on Kai and Pulisic at the 65th minute if we still look like this... no idea if it will help...",
    "12":"@hunterparker99 @usmntonly Lol Aaron with that assist matched Pulisic in goal contribution the season but took a million more minutes to do it. Pulisic is in good form. It ain\u2019t happening",
    "13":"@masteryodaiv @Beetlep95923146 @usmntonly @NBCSportsSoccer Pulisic is in fantastic form right now, have you not watched?",
    "14":"@masteryodaiv @usmntonly @NBCSportsSoccer Lol Aaron JUST matched Pulisic\u2019s goal contributions so far this season. \ud83d\ude02 he\u2019s played like a million more minutes",
    "15":"Pulisic, Havertz, Sterling and even Aubameyang would most likely miss this goal Ivan Toney scored to win the game for Brentford.\n\nThat's how disastrous and catastrophic Chelsea front has been this season that has led Newcastle to be +17 GD to Chelsea's +1 GD.",
    "16":"Christian Pulisic https:\/\/t.co\/lFxUDoFqMe",
    "17":"@goatwaa @DanielSmith1022 There are at least 6 other guys who can play RW and be just as effective as Morris (while also being able to play either MF or CF). Makes Morris obsolete.\n\nW\/MF\n\nPulisic\/Reyna\/Aaronson\/Musah\/Roldan (even tho yuck)\n\nW\/CF:\n\nSargent",
    "18":"@AnarchoMayo @ManagerTactical You don\u2019t need to change it = the point. Guys who are interchangeable at W\/MF:\n\nPulisic\nReyna\nAaronson\nMusah\nRoldan (although, bleh)\n\nInterchangeable W\/CF:\n\nSargent\n\nNot every side has this luxury. We didn\u2019t need Morris. We may need another in-form goal scorer.",
    "19":"@goobysnack1 @Ceruti @MaxBretosSports System needs Musah + Weah\/Pulisic to work AT ALL. Aaronson is a super sub or a replacement for Weston. The system doesn\u2019t work otherwise - at least if you\u2019re trying to actually score. Now if you\u2019re trying to close a match out with a lead, sure. But that sure ain\u2019t the beginning.",
    "20":"@Ceruti @MaxBretosSports You can spin it however you want, but it is 100% accurate. Brought a non-versatile, non-value add winger when Aaronson, Pulisic, and Musah can play both on the wing and in the midfield. This would be controversial even if Pepi WASN\u2019T in incredible form right now.",
    "21":"I cannot wait to watch Tim Weah, Christian Pulisic, Matt Turner, Weston McKennie and the new wave of USMNT. IMO this US mens team has the most potential I\u2019ve seen by far. Tons of speed. Who needs a true 9 when you have dynamic ball handling\/ striking forwards like CP and Weah",
    "22":"Given the roster, here's what I would like to see as the starting lineup in the World Cup:\nGK - Sean Johnson\nBacks - Dest, Robinson, Zimmerman, Carter-Vickers\nMF - Acosta, Adams, Musah, McKennie\nFwds - Pulisic, Reyna\nHowever, looking at the roster, tough to get out of the group",
    "23":"Ferreira, JoMo, Pulisic, Reyna, Sargent, Weah, Wright...No Pepi on the Roster",
    "24":"Graham Potter is not the problem. The Chelsea team has no bite and wits. The whole attacking front has got no goals in them one bit. Chances other team's front players get and make something off it, these lads waste them. Sterling, Havertz, Pulisic, Broja, Auba,etc offers nothing",
    "25":"Christian Pulisic playing 94 minutes of a meaningless Carabao Cup game right before the World Cup and not getting injured https:\/\/t.co\/SLZsmMaFAJ",
    "26":"The one time Potter plays Pulisic a full 90, it's right before the World Cup lol",
    "27":"If I were picking the #USMNT roster: \n\nPulisic, Pepi, Weah, Aaronson, Arriola, Ferreira, Sargent, Morris\n\nAdams, Musah, Reyna, McKennie, Acosta, Roldan, Mihailovic\n\nJedi, Long, Zimmerman, Dest, Yedlin, Scally, Carter-Vickers, Ream\n\nTurner, Horvath, Johnson",
    "28":"@Eric_Hess21 Was a good half! All the mount fan boys saying pulisic was awful \ud83d\ude44",
    "29":"Dear #ChelseaFC it\u2019s nice of you to play Pulisic for once...... \n\nPlease get him out of this meaningless Game. \ud83e\udd7a",
    "30":"@MccoyConlan Pulisic's best games for the national team have come at the 10. Plus if you start with those two out wide, both of them could interchange with Christian throughout the games to create total fluidity in attack. Could be beautiful\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d",
    "31":"@MccoyConlan Personally think this is our strongest lineup mids forward.\n\nReyna.      Weah.       Aaronson\n\n                  Pulisic\n\n       Adams.         McKennie",
    "32":"Lockdown Pulisic was a top 5 player in the world \ud83e\udd72 https:\/\/t.co\/HNxBQ56fH4",
    "33":"Wow FIFA simulation has Pulisic as the #4 scorer in the world cup... that would be borderline shocking tbh https:\/\/t.co\/aHJ5bq48BL"
