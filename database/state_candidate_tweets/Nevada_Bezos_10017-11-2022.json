    "3":"With the Bezos $$ announcement, a good time to encourage everyone to read \"Winners Take All\" by Anand Giridharadas - one of the the best books I've ever read. The wealthiest wreak havoc to make their billions and then claim to fix it by philanthropy. https:\/\/t.co\/Twx2sfk0x1",
    "4":"\u201cThis is a giant statement, not just because of the amount of wealth he has, but because he might really have a ripple effect on what others choose to do.\u201d https:\/\/t.co\/ROmHQrkgmi",
    "5":"@DavidAFrench Then you have people like Gates, Bezos, Jobs, Ellison, who really do have what it takes for that role. And also the smarts to stick with what they know and not get lost in the idea that their genius applies to everything. None of them would have bought a social media company.",
    "6":"@suzseddon Automation makes employees unnecessary. It won\u2019t just be Bezos. It\u2019ll be all businesses. Fast food, delivery, vending. Most jobs can be automated. \n\nWhat they don\u2019t realize, is those replaceable people won\u2019t have money to buy their crap.",

    "10":"@ABC Disgusting. Don't get me wrong, I adore Dolly. It's Jeff Bezos that makes me sick. He treats his warehouse employees like trash. My husband made it 2 years. He was over worked and severely under paid. Let's talk about mandatory overtime during peak season and no time off allowed.",
    "11":"Bezos and Elon in their skinsuits. https:\/\/t.co\/48HVyLetEW",
    "12":"@TMZ And then he can go to space with Jeff Bezos and get educated that the world is not flat.",
