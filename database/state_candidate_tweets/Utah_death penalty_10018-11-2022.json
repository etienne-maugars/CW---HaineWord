    "0":"@AmyAnn19692783 @sltrib A life sentence seems like a much more effective deterrent to me. It also is less expensive than the death penalty, and doesn't run the possibility of wrongly executing innocent people (although spending years or decades behind bars while innocent is also not great).",
    "1":"@AmyAnn19692783 @sltrib The death penalty has a lot to do with sanctity of life, especially when it is used to kill innocent people.",
    "2":"@Jim_Jordan Yes if he did wrong should pay the penalty. Same as 45 and tou brown shirt MAGA attempt to over throw the goverment and election. Those crimes are by far greater then anything of hunter biden. Treason is punishable by death and a fitting end to MAGA.",
    "3":"This amounts to #Terrorism and all 4 found guilty should face the death penalty. Let them all walk up the 13 steps or be placed before a firing squad. A capital sentence is appropriate in this case.\nMH17: Court rules Russia-controlled group downed airliner https:\/\/t.co\/jfl7xyBZPf",

    "5":"@ztahoez @wrong_speak The hospital would get sued con civil court not get the death penalty. But punishment for any offense should be proportional to the severity of the harm caused. If child rapists do not get the death penalty why should drug offenders?",
    "6":"@justinamash @JordanGundy I like that he's going to 'ask' people to 'receive' it, though. Voluntary death penalty.",
    "7":"@AmyAnn19692783 @sltrib When is the legislature voting to end the death penalty? Or do they only care about the \"sanctity of life\" when it means they'll get Mormon\/evangelical votes?",
    "8":"Death Penalty for big Pharma?",
    "9":"@brandt5150 @kylechilton @KeneAkers \u201cShall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African race? If the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so\u201d (Brigham Young, March 8, 1863)",

    "11":"@joecct77 @MJ78045945 @olinobnizov @EricRSammons @shagbark_hick I agree with the OP and it also applies to supporting the death penalty.",
    "12":"1,500 protestors will get the death penalty in Iran. Many are kids! \nDid you know it's believed in Iran a women cannot die a virgin. So these girls that are 14,15,16,etc are getting r8ped, before they are killed. ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS!! #IranRevoIution2022 #IranProrests2022",
