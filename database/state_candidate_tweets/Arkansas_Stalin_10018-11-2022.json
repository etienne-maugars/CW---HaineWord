    "1":"@pennsylcranian2 @PippinResists @dkearnsjr @RepTroyNehls You know, we backed Stalin in WW2. No one was stupid enough to call him a good guy, though. He was a convenient ally who served our interests. How does dumping money into the Ukraine serve U.S. interests?",
    "2":"@PippinResists @dkearnsjr @RepTroyNehls Western democracies. Great Britain, United States, Canada, etc. Not nations that censor media, ban opposing political parties and have fascist regiments in their military.\n\nWe once allied with the Soviets. We didn't view Stalin as a good guy, though. That's the danger here.",

    "7":"@theRealKiyosaki You  quoting Stalin and ranting about Communism is really ironically sad."
