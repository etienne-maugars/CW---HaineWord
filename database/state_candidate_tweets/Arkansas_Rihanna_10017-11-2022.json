    "2":"@HoboPrincess_ @sammymullz @ohhhshtbtch @tvgirlz In Rihanna's position, she literally just has to show up when she comes on. The fans will never know the difference",
    "3":"@dont4getthewhat @rihanna @chrisbrown Stg, cuz everytime they did a joint together their voices sounded perfect together",
    "4":"@DomDaTrainer @rihanna @SavageXFenty You and me both want to be on that stage and we got what it takes!  I've been dm'ing her, tagging her, and doing the same with @SavageXFenty as well.  @fatbellybella said write it down and make it happen.  She ripped the runway for her last year.",
    "5":"@PopCrave @rihanna LETS GOOO",
    "6":"@lilschwartzie this is a very brief example of Depp\u2019s treatment of Heard. There are admissions of physical abuse, vaguely. Like i have said, Rihanna being an abuse survivor makes it a problem. https:\/\/t.co\/U19YXciNFY",
    "7":"@washingtonpost Why? Because Depp is a man and not to be believed? So Rihanna is misusing her platform for publicly supporting Depp? While Amber Heard has a DV history and is a pathological liar that tried to tarnish his reputation. So tired of the negative Depp narrative, do better!!!",
    "8":"ja t\u00f4 saturada de esperar \u00e1lbum novo da Rihanna \u00f3 fia n\u00e3o quer lan\u00e7ar t\u00e1 bom entao blz chega j\u00e1 deu desse papo"
