He\u2019s got imposter syndrome in thinking he\u2019s still in his prime when he\u2019s absolutely dog shit 90% of the time.\n\nNo club in their right mind goes anywhere near him when he has that much of an ego he thinks he\u2019s above everyone and everything.",
    "97":"@DaBeardedGooner I think everyone is panicking because Jesus isn\u2019t going to score 56 goals so they just assume Ronaldo would be plug-n-play in our system. They thought the same about Auba; nope.",
    "98":"#AFC | The amount of Arsenal fans saying they\u2019d take Ronaldo in January are the same ones come May that would condemn Arteta, Edu, and KSE for railroading our season when that one move alone would put literally everything in jeopardy. Auba drama wasn\u2019t enough for you?",
