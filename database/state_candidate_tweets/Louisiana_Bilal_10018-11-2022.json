    "1":"@khansherine9 @90Fiasco Black men are not monolithic! \nIt doesn't matter if you are black &amp; have black sons is not an excuse. \nSaying Bilal makes black men look bad is just playing into century old propaganda and just plain DUMB! \n#DoBetter\n#90DayFiance",
    "2":"Boy if I was Shaeeda I would\u2019ve ate Bilal up. She should\u2019ve told him he was a dignified Muslim man and not to let other people control his emotions and that he was embarrassing her and to apologize. #90DayFiance",
    "3":"So Bilal\u2019s ex wife can be overly involved in the relationship, go as far as telling Shaeeda to sign the prenup, stand over her like she wasn\u2019t tryna fight &amp; that was all ok. But Shaeeda\u2019s friend is too involved? Girl swing on him for us #90DayFiance #90DayFianceHappilyEverAfter https:\/\/t.co\/j9TJnIrEKZ",
    "4":"Solid entertainment each time Bilal is shocked when someone doesn\u2019t think he walks on water the way he does. #90DayFianceHappilyEverAfter",
    "5":"I can 100% relate to this writer\u2019s block situation\n\nI agree the solution is to \u201cjust write,\u201dwhich unfortunately sounds super vague\n\nDr Bilal presents an excellent, more specific way to force oneself to get words on the page https:\/\/t.co\/d4s3pTe3Ek",
