    "2":"FTX collapse was due to centralization, and the meltdown only highlights the need for DeFi\n\nAlthough DeFi has a lot of room for improvement, once adopted, it can truly save people from financial frauds and moral hazards caused by centralized entities\n\nLet\u2019s keep BUIDLing https:\/\/t.co\/UQOLpqmk9a",
    "3":"However, attackers can easily hack wrapped assets, and sometimes wrapping relies on centralized entities\n\nFor example, Wormhole bridge lost $321M by the attack in February. Also, the price of $soBTC on Solana collapsed when its backer, FTX collapsed\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/WaGFk3CIJj",

    "8":"TL;DR\n\n1. DeFi is gaining popularity since FTX collapse\n\n2. However, DeFi needs to improve user experience, scalability, and cross-chain asset transfer to attract more users\n\n3. Account abstraction, rollups, and cross-chain communication can lead to the mass adoption of DeFi",
