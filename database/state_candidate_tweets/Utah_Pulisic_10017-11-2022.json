    "0":"@itschappy Dear Nike,\nWhy did you put the patch top center?\nAnd why don\u2019t you have a Pulisic jersey for sale on your website?\n\ud83d\ude44",
    "1":"@usmntonly The only names in the lineup before his are Pulisic &amp; Adams.\n\nNo one else in the entire pool is playing this many minutes in this important of a position at this high of a level. \n\nLove Musah, Reyna, McKennie, etc, but they\u2019re all either playing less, lesser comp or inconsistent",
    "2":"@CantHitWRISP Need Newcastle to complete the signing in January tbh. Rotating between ASM\/Pulisic on the left would be a nightmare for defenses",
    "3":"@SutroLites @JoAdellFans Potter at least fits what they were trying to build with a great defense. Havertz is a horrible striker, should be back in the Bundesliga in January. Pulisic looked the most dangerous player for you guys today and they don\u2019t start him",
    "4":"Seems like if Pulisic puts his body in a better position, he\u2019s either keeping it in the 18, or getting knocked over for a penalty. \ud83e\udd37#NEWCHE",
    "5":"Excited to see how Pulisic does on his Newcastle audition \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb#NEWCHE",
    "6":"@__adel11 She was the one that did the Chelsea game where she hated on Pulisic nonstop even when he scored",
    "7":"So Adams needs to be subbed off immediately (won't happen), Pulisic needs to be on the bench, and Aaronson around the 75'",
    "8":"@USMNT @budweiserusa Best starting 11?\nAaronson-Pulisic-Reyna\nMcKinnie-Adams-Musah\nRobinson-Zimmerman-Ream-Dest\nTurner",
    "9":"How I'd line the announced USMNT up. Pulisic playing as a false 9. I'm happy to listen an argument for Aaronson over Weah\/Reyna, or why Ream shouldn't be starting. https:\/\/t.co\/RWJukkCx3l",
    "10":"One thing that probably everyone may overlook in the Haji over Pepi thing: Haji is Pulisic's, McKennie's and more's bff. They all grew up playing together. I wonder how much chemistry played into it.",
    "11":"Pulisic REALLY saving his goals for the WC.",
    "12":"Helluva touch from Pulisic there. But offside. Now PULL HIM OUT PLEASE",
    "13":"SUB OUT PULISIC ALREADY\n\n#USMNT",
    "14":"@USMNTvsHaters Maybe. But no arguing this was a horrible touch by pulisic",
    "15":"Pulisic is garbage. \nU.S men\u2019s team is indeed garbage. \nUnited States in general is garbage.",
    "16":"Pulisic. Has to score that.",
    "17":"Whoa. Time to bring in Pulisic https:\/\/t.co\/tWz53fk08G",
    "18":"Okay, so Pulisic, Aaronson, Adams all come off the bench today \ud83d\ude4f, and then have a mysterious illness this weekend that makes them unavailable.",
    "19":"@CastelloIsaacs @bash_man_ who that? Pulisic?\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
    "20":"Who is the FIRST name on the sheet for GGG? Pulisic? Reyna? McKennie?"
