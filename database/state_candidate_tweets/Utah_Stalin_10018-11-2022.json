    "0":"@resnikoff I think the point is to associate his ideas with negatively viewed historical events and then imply that that is his only contribution to our world.\n\nThey are saying that Marx gave us Stalin and Mao and nothing else.",
    "1":"@StevenBeschloss Thank you for your elitist, mindless, woke comment, comrade. Your party loyalty is duly noted. Keep your Stalin on!",
    "2":"@gstalin1 Thanks, Stalin!",
    "3":"@marylandguy57 @deangloster @josh_hammer According to this podcast, Stalin murdered all the revolutionaries actually responsible for bringing the Communist Revolution to fruition. Could it therefore not be argued that Stalinism is no different from McCarthyism? That Stalin was anti-communist?\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/ueY0beuU1G",
    "4":"@joncoopertweets Good suggestion. That's what Stalin would do.",
    "5":"@nkaber1 @charliekirk11 The quote is attributed to Stalin but it's not a direct quote. Napoleon said something similar.",
    "6":"@scottjohnson Putin, Trump, Stalin, Mao, the entire Kim family of North Korea....but wait there;s more",
    "7":"@lordrhavin @BgeparteiBE @Piraten_SN Du sprichst von Masse Volk-ich von #Demagogen #Despoten #Diktatoren #Tyrannen die das Volk in der Hand haben und verhetzen.\n#S\u00f6der, #Merz, #Orban, #Bolsonaro, #Trump, #Lenin, #Stalin, etc etc etc haben alle sehr intellente Leute, die die Strategien ausarbeiten. Sind nicht Dumm!",
    "8":"@NoStepOnJohn @beinlibertarian Neither Mao nor Stalin were fascist. And lots of countries have gun control that aren't fascist.",
    "9":"@ChrisO_wiki It\u2019s similar to Nazi conquests during Operation Barbarossa. Many of the people in the conquered areas did not feel kindly to Stalin, but the Germans were so tone-deaf to the occupied people that they quickly alienated them. Same mentality here.",
    "10":"@Acyn So much for due process. Remember When Russia did this?? Ohhhh Stalin. \ud83d\ude02",
    "11":"100,000 is a big number. This is also the numbers of #Russians killed and wounded. The same holds true for the #Ukrainian military. 100,000. Thousands of families whose lives have been indelibly altered because #Putin is a wannabe #Stalin. 100,000."
