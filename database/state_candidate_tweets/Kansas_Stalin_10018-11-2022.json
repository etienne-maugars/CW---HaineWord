    "0":"Democrats have done an amazing job at mastering the Art of voter fraud while convincing the public. Any criticism of their theft is paranoia and denial. This is classic Joseph Stalin. Time to take the gloves off.",
    "1":"@Hidenseek94 @Timcast Depends on the recipe. In my opinion this is the recipe for how to use propaganda to enrage people to make them not trust democracy. That\u2019s what Stalin would do since he was anti-democracy.",
    "2":"@NorthByNrthWest @JoJoFromJerz I recommend reading about Pol Pot, Stalin, Maduro\/Chavez, Hitler, and other fascinating military\/political leaders. One will find it enlightening.",
    "3":"@cocozzello @REDPILL_MSN @JoJoFromJerz The one that will save anti-second-amendment purveyors' sorry ***** when the Communists (a.k.a., The Squad) get real ugly. Read about Stalin, Castro, and Chivas\/Maduro. I feel one will find it enlightening.",
    "4":"@mhdksafa Also educate them on how important guns are. The Second Amendment has never been about hunting deer. Ask anyone who lived under Stalin, Mao, Polpot, Hitler. The revolutionary war was fought by citizens. That is how the U.S. was formed.",
    "5":"@Delean_dro Puse Stalin 2 veces https:\/\/t.co\/LFCPrGRIcv",
    "6":"@Delean_dro Encima el loco est\u00e1 como\n\n\"Y aqu\u00ed tenemos a Stalin \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29 con 2 tacitas de t\u00e9, luego est\u00e1 Pinochet todo bonito uwu y finalmente Stalin \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\"",
    "7":"@CaesarianHoxha This is why I stopped talking about stalin lmao. It comes off like....this, pretty often",
    "8":"@PatsyWilliams1 @Jpg_2222 @samanthamarika1 @LindseyGrahamSC @GOPLeader So does Hitler, and Stalin, and Pol Pot....",
    "9":"@One1Epic @akafacehots @POTUS @JoeBiden Yall they just admitted they don't think Stalin, Mussolini, Zedong, Hussein, Il-Sung, Jong-Il, and Jong-Un aren't that bad",
    "10":"@FasoloDavid @Scout89027994 @kim_amerie Dems deserve to be attacked.  They are socialists.  Dems idolize Josef Stalin and Mao rather than Thomas Jefferson.  They are also rabid racists."
