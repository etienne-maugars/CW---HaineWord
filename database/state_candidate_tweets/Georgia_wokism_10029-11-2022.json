    "1":"@ItzGauti18 @elonmusk @mtaibbi It was already being shadow-run by the government. THATS what Fascism is. Read some history about the Third Reich and IG Farben, Volkswagen, or Bayer. Socialist government directing businesses how to act in the interest of the state. Wokism is a nasty cancer",

    "3":"@POTUS I guess the all time low in morale, putting wokism as the top priority, harrasing and pushing out people who dont agree with your politics and the botched Afghanistan  withdrawal is all we need to point at to show you don\u2019t care about our military"
