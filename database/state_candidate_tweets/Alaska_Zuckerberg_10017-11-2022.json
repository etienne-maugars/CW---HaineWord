    "0":"What the fuck? @facebook @fbsecurity #Zuckerberg https:\/\/t.co\/6p72dQnTOT",
    "1":"@gumpernickle @PeterRHann1 @pulte That\u2019s completely false. Look at numbers. SBF gave over 50m to Dems this cycle and promised upto 1b for Biden in 24.  Dems have become party of wealthy, Wall Street and tech. Zuckerberg gave 400m last cycle in partisan areas to change the election. So please do some research.",
    "2":"@JUNlPER I know at least four people that have worked for him and the most consistent thing I've heard is he is one of the most psychotic people they've ever had to deal with. All round just a bad guy. One of them works for fucking Zuckerberg now and says it's preferable to him.",
    "3":"@SecretService @FBI @FBIMilwaukee @TheJusticeDept @JusticeOIG @CIA @NSAGov @DeptofDefense @DoD_IG @fox11news @WBAY @NBC26 @WFRVLocal5 @EcoHealthNYC @MetaNewsroom @facebook @FacebookWatch @FacebookGaming @facebookapp @fbsecurity @Facebook @FBOversight\nMark Zuckerberg is an accomplice to killing all my family members with lab grown bacteria as he has been directly manipulating my Facebook account.",
    "4":"@Erin1137 @TheCiscoKidder I don\u2019t think we can say that anymore. Musk is just as bad or worse than Zuckerberg. Probably helps that my whole family and my h.s. friends are all Dems, which makes FB bearable. This isn\u2019t a social platform for me, but more of a way to hear news sooner.",
    "5":"@nivizivi @ecerv2004 @Redistrict Democracy in the park in Madison, WI benefits Rs? Mark Zuckerberg orgs, that are openly Democrat, benefits Rs? Ballot drop boxes in Milwaukee WI benefits Rs?",
    "6":"@CollinSutherla2 @nusubscribed @Deb_Veik @GRDecter I wasn\u2019t arguing with you. You said the Dems are moving back towards small donors. I agree to a point. But the real money is coming from large donations like Soros, Zuckerberg, Jobs &amp; Sam Bankman-Fried who donated $40mm last election cycle.",
    "7":"@CollinSutherla2 @nusubscribed @Deb_Veik @GRDecter You call Soros a \u201csmall donor\u201d? He alone, not counting his kid or family foundation contributed $128mm. Might want to vet that out. Most comes through PAC $. Ask Zuckerberg",
    "8":"@paulg A serious answer to your question is that leftists' main grievance is against wealth _inequality_, not against wealth per se. At a current net worth of $32 billion, Zuckerberg is still vastly more wealthy than 99.9% of humanity, so they still see him as greedy.",
    "9":"@oneunderscore__ Remember when you all hated Zuckerberg so much because \"he cost Hillary Clinton the election\" lol.\nYou people are a sad bunch.",
    "10":"If y'all ever think Elon Musk is somehow a bad person remember that Mark Zuckerberg exists.",
    "11":"@theskindoctor13 @elonmusk What?! Zuckerberg has been under fire since he started Facebook! Have you not paid attention to the congressional hearings with his butt in the hot seat?! Year after year!",
    "12":"@Saaaaaammmmiiii You're talking jibberish Elon bought Twitter 2 protect free speech. He has made this perfectly clear idk why you can't grasp this. His predecessors did just the opposite they silenced an entire political party just like Zuckerberg is doing on fb. You're ok with this I'm guessing",
    "13":"Where is the democrats outrage? We heard them when Musk let go of 7,500 but not when Zuckerberg lets go of 11,000 why is that?  https:\/\/t.co\/L45vqzijQY",
    "14":"https:\/\/t.co\/8GCT6p9WJ3",
    "15":"Ouch!\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/fg6BZlfbHd",
    "16":"\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\n\u203c\ufe0fJUST IN - Zuckerberg cuts 11,000 jobs at Facebook owner Meta.\n\nHe apologizes for \"getting it wrong\" in a message to staff.\n\n@disclosetv",
    "17":"@Austen Don't the have like 2 billion active accounts on Facebook?\n\nDid you hear the Zuckerberg interview on Rogan a few months ago? He mentioned things I'd never though of before, that because of Facebook's global presence, they basically need staff in every country.",
    "18":"\"I know this is tough for everyone, and I\u2019m especially sorry to those impacted.\"\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/So8BITwf5s\nvia ABC News App",
    "19":"Another obvious sign of a strong economy\u2026\n\nBREAKING: Meta Laying Off 11,000 Employees After Stock Plunges on Metaverse Bet https:\/\/t.co\/taNy0GQjyb",
    "20":"Just voted in Wisconsin. Zuckerberg rigged the last election. No 3rd party money was on this ballot. Very cool. God bless America",
    "21":"@kittler420 @covie_93 Also worth noting that neither Bloomberg, nor Gates, nor Zuckerberg were born into extreme wealth, like Elon; and unlike Elon, they all built something from nothing.",
    "22":"@elonmusk If you would\u2019ve bought meta that would\u2019ve been cool too thats like 3 giant plate forms plus another technology company also i hate zuckerberg and his stupid community standards"
