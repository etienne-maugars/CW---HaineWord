    "3":"Take a second and really ask yourself is Putin the bad guy ? Really he's telling the people in the US not to give up their guns . Maybe because Russia remember how Adolf Hitler took all the guns and started killing the people.",
    "4":"@PoliticsVerse If the price is the raise of another hitler the cost will be MUCH MUCH higher later.  Putin is a psychopath criminal, sooner is stopped lesser the damage.  Already he did too much",
