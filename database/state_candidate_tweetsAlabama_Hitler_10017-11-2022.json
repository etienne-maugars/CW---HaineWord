    "1":"Hitler's most famous line was \"Make Germany Great Again.\"\nSound familiar?\nThat's why the magots have adopted the \"Make America Great Again\", to sound patriotic.\nThis is a recreation of Hitler's motto done by none other than Stephen Miller, a Jewish Nazi himself.",
    "2":"@Jose_Paris @SandraOrchidee Je crois surtout que Hitler est mort il y a 77 ans et que de le convoquer en permanence d\u00e9vie la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de nouvelles menaces, bien r\u00e9elles celles ci",
    "3":"@LifeNewsHQ Correct.  That does not make it right.  Slavery was the most popular policy in several states for 8 decades. Adolf Hitler was democratically elected. The current war in Ukraine is approved by a majority of Russians. Democracy is merely a style of government.",

    "8":"@Radbug11 @V3Turkish31 @BoxesBoi @allthatyazzz You aren't one in my eyes, you are just a machine thing, doing machine things.\n\nYou are letting emotions rule you, not logic or reasoning, you are a dangerous instructor for teaching impressionable children.\n\nLiterally a teacher of Hitler youth with different robes.",
    "9":"@BDolph1n @TheBlueisin123 one thing I find funny is when people say Hitler was a right-winger when the Nazi Party was socialist. Communism and socialism is fascism. People say Hitler was worse because he killed Jews, so to me people consider 6 million Jews more important than 80 million gentiles.",
    "10":"I've had arguments with people with me saying Stalin was worse than Hitler but almost everyone agreed that Hitler was worse because he killed Jews. 6 million Jews are more important than 80 million gentiles. Let that sink in.",
    "11":"I find it ironic how there are less deaths globally per year compared to the amount of deaths from Joseph Stalin. Stalin was worse than Hitler but yet no one talks about Stalin because he was a communist.",

The concern is that Putin won\u2019t stop with just Ukraine. It\u2019s a question of where do you put the arbitrary line in the sand.",
